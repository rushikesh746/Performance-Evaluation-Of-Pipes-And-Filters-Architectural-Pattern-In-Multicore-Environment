# Performance-Evaluation-Of-Pipes-And-Filters-Architectural-Pattern-In-Multicore-Environment

Evaluated the performance of pipes and filters architecture on various factors such as
number of packets, filters, cores and suggested an adaptive architectural pattern to
overcome problems such as bottlenecking and optimizing the performance for synchro-
nized data transfer.
